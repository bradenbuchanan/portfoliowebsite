              in the travel space.</li>
            <li>One way Airbnb is trying to achieve this is by uncovering new opportunities in the travel industry.</li>
            <li>This could involve expanding into new markets or verticals, developing new products or services, or
              exploring new partnerships and collaborations.</li>

      <div class="context-container">
        <h2>Define the market through a JTBD lens</h2>
        <p>There are typically 3 main "customers" when looking at our solution through the JTBD lens.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li class="define-market-list"><strong>The job executor</strong>: this is the person using the product to get
            the core functional job done.</li>
          <li class="define-market-list"><strong>The product lifecycle support team</strong>: this consists of the
            varying groups of people who support the product throughout its lifecycle. This includes people who install,
            transport, repair, maintain, upgrade or dispose of the product. They execute consumption chain jobs.</li>
          <li class="define-market-list"><strong>The buyer</strong>: those who are responsible for making the financial
            purchase decision.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Since we are interested in understanding the core job and all the outcome statements for the primary executor
          of Airbnb (e.g., the end buyer), we will focus on the <strong>individuals who book Airbnbs</strong> and not
          those who list on Airbnb.

    <!-- Define the core job -->
    <section id="define-core-job">
      <!-- <div class="context-container"> -->
      <h2>Define the core job</h2>
      <p>Determining the functional core job for any JTBD projects is the most tricky part of starting a project.
        Ultimately, we are interested in what our job executor
        is trying to <strong>accomplish using our product/service</strong>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Depending on the goals of the research, we can determine the <strong>flight level</strong> of our core job.</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="flight-level-list"><strong>lower flight level (e.g., closer to the product)</strong>: Will generate
          outcome statements that are
          closet to our product and service. Choosing a functional core job at this level
          would be great for understanding new generation product improvements.
        </li>
        <li class="flight-level-list"><strong>Higher flight level (e.g., farther away from the product)</strong>: Will
          generate outcome statements
          that are farther to our product and service. Choosing a functional core job at this level
          would be great for looking outside of our solution into totally new areas. For example, if Airbnb used a JTBD
          study to explore the functional core job of "Plan a vacation", this would uncover outcome statements (e.g.,
          needs)
          from a wide variety of solution spaces vs a core job that is at a lower flight level.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Create a job map</h2>
      <p>To create the job map, i interviewed 11 participants from UserTesting to create the job map and uncover
        outcomes related to the functional core job of planning a vacation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>These interviews helped uncover the <strong>ideal sequence of steps</strong> traveler planners need when
        planning a vacation. I learned this job can be broken down into 9 chronological steps that each have their own
        unique set of outcome statements.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some interview questions I used to help create the job map are below...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What needs to be defined or planned before planning a vacation?</li>
        <li>What needs to be located or gathereed before planning a vacation?</li>
        <li>What needs to be prepared or set up before planning a vacation?</li>
        <li>What needs to be confirmed before planning a vacation?</li>

      <h2>Uncover outcome statements based on the core job</h2>
      <div class="context-container-uncover-outcome">
        <p>Throughout the 11 qualitative interviews, I actively listened and documented every pain point, frustration,
          or annoyance that participants expressed when attempting to plan a vacation.
          <br>
          <br>
          After each interview, I went through my notes and translated each pain, frustration, etc. into <strong>desired
            outcome statements</strong>.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>For example, if I heard...</strong>
          <br>
          "I wish I knew I needed my covid vaccine printed out to get my airline ticket."
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>I would translate this to...</strong>
          <br>
          Minimize the time it takes to determine if travel documents are required before travel.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the end of 11 qualitative interviews, I ended up with <strong>115</strong> desired outcome statements.

          <p>Visually we can see that most of the outcome statements are in the approximately served and underserved

      <h2>Outcome-based Segmentation</h2>
      <p>Outcome-based market segmentation is a process of identifying groups of customers with different unmet needs
        based on their desired outcomes.
        This approach focuses on understanding the "job" that the customer is trying to accomplish and uses their unmet
        desired outcomes as the basis for segmentation.</p>
      <p>Below are the steps to segment the market based on outcomes.</p>
      <img src="img/needs-based-segmentation-img.png" alt="">
      <figure>
        <figcaption class="outcome-based-caption">
          <a href="https://jobs-to-be-done.com/market-segmentation-through-a-jobs-to-be-done-lens-5ef9242de65"
            target="_blank">Outcome-based segmentation reveals segments of customers with different unmet needs — and
            the
            context that causes customers to struggle to get the job done.</a>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>



      <p>I did this segmentation in RStudio. After the cluster analysis, I exported each cluster ID and put them back in
        my excel file to create opportunity landscapes for each segment.
        I tried 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 clusters but based on the outcomes and profiling data, the 3 segment cluster made the most
        sense based on the data.
      </p>
      <img src="img/3-travel-segments.png" alt="" class="three-travel-segments">
      <p>In the end there were 3 clear segments based on the data. The Leisure Traveler, the Efficient Traveler, and the
        Budget-Savvy Traveler. Each segment has a variety of unmet needs, varying segment size, differing demographics,
        and areas of opportunities for a company like Airbnb to tackle.</p>

      <p>Below are a list of recommended next steps </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immersion workshop of the insights to the applicable product teams or business leaders. No more than 20
          people.
          Goal of the immersion workshop is to “immerse” into the insights. Understand what questions the insights can
          answer, limitations, and key takeaways for each team/stakeholder.
        </li>
        <li>Activation workshop where we bring back the relevant stakeholders and “activate” the insights based on our
          strategic direction as a business.
        </li>
        <li>Work with data scientists and business analytics team to determine if we can identify any of our segments
          with
          current solution usage.
        </li>
        <li>Link insights to the organizations insights repository or Google site so anyone can access the information.

      <h2>Reflections and improvements for next time</h2>
      <p>Below is a list of improvements I would make next time before conducting a large-scale quant JTBD research
        study
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine the organization's preferred method of sharing insights. Some organizations prefer everything to
          be
          done in G-suite, some prefer everything to be done using Microsoft 365, and others are open to either. The
          reason
          to determine this is that Microsoft 365 (excel, PowerPoint) offers much more customization to build precise
          graphs, visualizations, and ways to present data vs. Google-suite.</li>
        <li>Align with business leaders, product managers, data scientists, and any other relevant stakeholders to help
          support, frame, and provide their expertise on the study. My goal is to democratize research in the
          organization.
          I don’t want the work I do to be in a silo.</li>
        <li>Interview a large enough qualitative sample size to ensure no more patterns emerge from the interviews. If
          forced to give a hard number due to budget reasons, at least 15-20.</li>
        <li>Use a fielding agency to administer the survey using a CAVI data collection method. If tight budget uses
          Qualtrics or an in-house survey platform and send via CRM system to users who would like to take the survey
          (ideally they would be compensated for their time).</li>
        <li>For next time, I would have liked to try and change the JTBD outcome statement syntax to something more
          easily-interpretable for users. Instead of saying "minimize the time it takes...", use the words "avoid" or
          "quicky". </li>
