    <p id="foreward">This is a personal project I wanted to do to practice with my understand of the Jobs-to-be-Done

          <ul>
            <li>Airbnb has faced challenges in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted the
              travel industry.</li>
            <li>As a result, the company has had to adapt its business strategy and find new ways to grow profitability
              in the travel space.</li>
            <li>One way Airbnb is trying to achieve this is by uncovering new opportunities in the travel industry.</li>
            <li>This could involve expanding into new markets or verticals, developing new products or services, or
              exploring new partnerships and collaborations.</li>
            <li>With this in mind, there is a need to understand the key unmet needs within segments of users planning a
              vacation.</li>

        <h2>Define the market through a JTBD lens</h2>
        <p>There are typically 3 main "customers" when looking at our solution through the JTBD lens.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li class="define-market-list"><strong>The job executor</strong>: this is the person using the product to get
            the core functional job done.</li>
          <br>
          <li class="define-market-list"><strong>The product lifecycle support team</strong>: this consists of the
            varying groups of people who support the product throughout its lifecycle. This includes people who install,
            transport, repair, maintain, upgrade or dispose of the product. They execute consumption chain jobs.</li>
          <br>
          <li class="define-market-list"><strong>The buyer</strong>: those who are responsible for making the financial
            purchase decision.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Since we are interested in understanding the core job and all the outcome statements for the primary executor
          of Airbnb (e.g., the end buyer), we will focus on the <strong>individuals who book Airbnbs</strong> and not
          those who list on Airbnb.

      <!-- <div class="context-container"> -->
      <h2>Define the core job</h2>
      <p>Determining the functional core job for any JTBD projects is the most tricky part of starting a project.
        Ultimately, we are interested in what our job executor
        is trying to <strong>accomplish using our product/service</strong>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Depending on the goals of the research, we can determine the <strong>flight level</strong> of our core job.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>lower flight level (e.g., closer to the product)</strong>: Will generate outcome statements that are
          closet to our product and service. Choosing a functional core job at this level
          would be great for understanding new generation product improvements.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Higher flight level (e.g., farther away from the product)</strong>: Will generate outcome statements
          that are farther to our product and service. Choosing a functional core job at this level
          would be great for looking outside of our solution into totally new areas. For example, if Airbnb used a JTBD
          study to explore the functional core job of "Plan a vacation", this would uncover outcome statements (e.g.,
          needs)
          from a wide variety of solution spaces vs a core job that is at a lower flight level.
        </li>
        <br>
      </ol>

      <img src="img/core job flight level travel.jpg" alt="" id="core-job-travel-img">
      <br>
      <p>With the above in mind, I chose to go for the functional core job of: <strong>Plan a vacation</strong></p>

      <h2>Create a job map</h2>
      <p>To create the job map, i interviewed 11 participants from UserTesting to create the job map and uncover
        outcomes related to the functional core job of planning a vacation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>These interviews helped uncover the <strong>ideal sequence of steps</strong> traveler planners need when
        planning a vacation. I learned this job can be broken down into 9 chronological steps that each have their own
        unique set of outcome statements.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some interview questions I used to help create the job map are below...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What needs to be defined or planned before planning a vacation?</li>
        <li>What needs to be located or gathereed before planning a vacation?</li>
        <li>What needs to be prepared or set up before planning a vacation?</li>
        <li>What needs to be confirmed before planning a vacation?</li>

      <h2>Uncover outcome statements based on the core job</h2>
      <div class="context-container-uncover-outcome">
        <p>Throughout the 11 qualitative interviews, I actively listened and documented every pain point, frustration,
          or annoyance that participants expressed when attempting to plan a vacation.
          <br>
          <br>
          After each interview, I went through my notes and translated each pain, frustration, etc. into <strong>desired
            outcome statements</strong>.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>For example, if I heard...</strong>
          <br>
          "I wish I knew I needed my covid vaccine printed out to get my airline ticket."
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>I would translate this to...</strong>
          <br>
          Minimize the time it takes to determine if travel documents are required before travel.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the end of 11 qualitative interviews, I ended up with <strong>115</strong> desired outcome statements.

          <p>After compiling a list of outcome statements and complexity factors (e.g., situations, reasons, moments to
            why it is more difficult to perform the core job than others),
            I created a google form to hold my survey.</p>
          <p>In an ideal world, I would use a platform like Qualtrics or a
            fielding agency to conduct the survey to ensure 1. higher data quality and 2. more customization with the
            survey.</p>
          <p>Survey was sent out using a mixture of leftover UserTesting credits and online forums.</p>

            straightliners (SD SAT <.25) and by noticing patterns in how participants filled out the survey (conditional
              formatting in excel).</p>
              <p>Next step is to calculate the opportunity score for each outcome statement and create a total market opportunity landscape.</p>

          <p>Visually we can see that most of the outcome statements are in the approximately served and underserved areas, while few of the needs are in the overserved area.</p>
          <p>There are <strong>27</strong> underserved needs from a total market perspective</p>

    <section id="outcome-based-segmentation">
      <h2>Outcome-based Segmentation</h2>
        <p>Outcome-based market segmentation is a process of identifying groups of customers with different unmet needs based on their desired outcomes. 
          This approach focuses on understanding the "job" that the customer is trying to accomplish and uses their unmet desired outcomes as the basis for segmentation.</p>
        <p>Below are the steps to segment the market based on outcomes.</p>
        <img src="img/needs-based-segmentation-img.png" alt="">
        <figcaption class="outcome-based-caption">
          <a href="https://jobs-to-be-done.com/market-segmentation-through-a-jobs-to-be-done-lens-5ef9242de65" target="_blank">Outcome-based segmentation reveals segments of customers with different unmet needs — and the context that causes customers to struggle to get the job done.</a>
        </figcaption>
        
        <p>I did this segmentation in RStudio. After the cluster analysis, I exported each cluster ID and put them back in my excel file to create opportunity landscapes for each segment.
          I tried 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 clusters but based on the outcomes and profiling data, the 3 segment cluster made the most sense based on the data.
        </p>
        <img src="img/3-travel-segments.png" alt="" class = "three-travel-segments">
        <p>In the end there were 3 clear segments based on the data. The Leisure Traveler, the Efficient Traveler, and the Budget-Savvy Traveler. Each segment has a variety of unmet needs, varying segment size, differing demographics, and areas of opportunities for a company like Airbnb to tackle.</p>
