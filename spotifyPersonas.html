              <h2>Context</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>With the recent acquisitions of Sonantic &
                    Findaway, Spotify is accelerating the development
                    of their audiobook feature.</li>
                <li>With this in mind, business leaders want to
                    understand what Spotify users an audiobook feature
                    would fulfill the needs of.</li>
                <li>There is a need for a common aligned
                    understanding of how users use, experience, and
                    value the entire Spotify ecosystem.</li>

              <h2>Objectives</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Is there a segment of Spotify users who will benefit the
                    most from an audiobook feature (e.g. will it address a key
                    unmet need)?</li>
                <li>Do we at Spotify have a clear understanding of how users
                    use our app?</li>
                <li>Do we understand users product use, their behaviors, attitudes toward
                    music/audio, etc.?</li>

              <h2 class="project-1-context">Research approach</h2>
              <p>For this research, I used two qualitative research methods</p>
              <ul>
                <li>1-1 remote interviews using JTBD qualitative interviewing.
                </li>
                <li>Ethnographic research with 3 participants.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>Below is my rationale for why I chose to go with this research approach.</p>

                <h2>Ethnographic Research</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>provides deep insights into how users interact with a product in their real-world context. 
                    This helps identify factors that may influence their behaviors and attitudes, 
                    which may not be evident in controlled research settings.</li>
                  <li>Ethnographic research generates rich, qualitative data that can provide a nuanced understanding of users' experiences, motivations, and challenges. </li>
                  <li>When there is budget, time, and ability to conduct Enthographic research, it is always more fun to observe people in their 
                    natural environments interact with the products/services :)

                <ul>
                  <li>JTBD research is centered on the user and their needs and motivations, rather than on the product or service itself. This can help you to gain a deeper understanding of the reasons why people use Spotify and what they hope to achieve by using the service.</li>
                  <li>JTBD research can help to provide a richer understanding of the broader context in which people use Spotify, including the circumstances and situations in which they use the service. </li>
                  <li>By focusing on the underlying job that people are trying to accomplish when using Spotify, JTBD research can reveal unmet needs or pain points that the service may not be addressing. This can help to inform product development and improve the user experience.</li>

                    <p>For this research I conducted 16 interviews (13 virtual via UserTesting and 3 in-person).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Below is a few demographic highlights from the sample</p>

            <h2>Research Synthesis</h2>
            <p>Following each interview, I generated a comprehensive report summarizing the participant's attitudes and behaviors towards their usage of Spotify. Specifically, I documented the key features that each individual used and explored the underlying goals that motivated their use of these features. To gain a better understanding of how Spotify was integrated into each individual's daily routine, I asked contextual questions that probed their usage habits. Utilizing this information, I grouped my notes into clusters based on the unmet needs that Spotify was addressing for each individual and the specific reasons behind their usage patterns.</p>
            <img src="img/participant9.jpg" alt="" class = "participant9">
            <p>After the 16 interviews, I was able to identify common themes, attitudes, and behaviors in the way people used Spotify.
              For example, a surpirse to me was that some individuals only used Spotify to find podcasts that narrated audiobooks for them. 
              These individuals barely used Spotify for the music discovery or keeping a music library, but they loved being able to be immersed
               into a great audiobook. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Once these themes were identified, I started with the development of the personas. For the design, I wanted to highlight
             7 key ways to differentiate them from one another. These 7 ways are below</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Persona Summary</li>
                <li>Functional and emotional jobs</li>
                <li>Unique characteristics</li>
                <li>How to message to this persona</li>
                <li>App usage</li>
                <li>Ideal solution</li>
                <li>Podcast usage</li>
              </ul>

              <p>One more conscious decision I made for these personas was to make them different than the typical "consumer" or "buyer" personas.
                There is nothing wrong with these types of personas, but I wanted to create personas that were more based on the attitudes, behaviors, and 
                unique unmet needs each persona. I always felt that the typical type of personas online are very surface level and don't go deep into truly 
                understanding the user.
              </p>
              <p>Below you can see the 6 personas that were developed based on my research findings.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The results were that 6 unique Spotify personas came from the analysis of the research.</p>
            <p>Here are some high level summaries of each persona.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Audiobook Aficionado</strong>
                  <ul>

Their music preferences may be influenced by their taste in fiction, gravitating towards soundtracks or atmospheric tracks that complement their favorite stories.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Curious Learner</strong>
                  <ul>

                  </ul>
              </li>
                <li><strong>Pure Sound Seeker</strong>

                  <li>This persona is likely to engage in passive listening, letting Spotify's algorithmic recommendations take the lead.

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>The next steps of this project would be to quantify these personas so we can get an accurate market sizing for each and understand which persona to target as an early adopter for the new audiobook feature. 
            </p>
            <p>The "obvious" choices are the Audiobook Aficionado or potentially the Curious Learner, however, we would need to understand their expectations for an audiobook section as part of Spotify and if our offering is what they expect. 
              Spotify could create an audiobook section in the app, but if it fails to deliver value for any persona, it could actually hurt Spotify's brand.
            </p>
            <p>My assumption is Spotify did research prior to acquiring the audiobook startups 
              with their current userbase on segmenting the market or creating personas to determine an early adopter to target for this feature and how to address their core needs.

            <h2>Reflections and improvements for next time</h2>
            <p>Below is a list of improvements and suggestions I would make next time before conducting a qualitative persona project similar to this one.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I had to stop interviewing at 16 due to limitations with UserTesting credits. Next time I would like to interview as many participants as needed until I hit data saturation. Similar to how academics do qualitative research, they keep going with interviews until they reach data saturation.</li>
              <li>In the real world, aligning with data scientists and looking at the actual product data of how people use a product would have been a great first step to help inform this research.</li>
              <li>The app usage section in the persona posters truthfully isn't that helpful from my perspective and the design is not the best. It's hard to tell with the shading which one the viewer is supposed to focus on. I kept this design flaw in here to highlight I'm not a perfect designer, nor will I ever be. I thrive working with a team of great people (designers, researchers, engineers, etc.) to bounce ideas off of and help make me better.</li>
            </ul>
